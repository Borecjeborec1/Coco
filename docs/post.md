# Coco - compiled JS with the speed of Raw c++. The node and bun competitor.

_TL;DR: Random developer created js "translator" into the c++. Now he craves for some github stars. Repo link: GITHUB_REPO_LINK_

About half a year ago IÂ´ve started this project, to be able to use js as a fast language for some CP (Competetive programming) projects. As time went on... bun vs node wars ... decided to publish it. So here it is.

Coco is a rly simply written translator that translates js code to c++. Nearly every living object (except some humans) can understand its source code.

-   Briefly how it translates
-   Advantages
    -   Compiled
    -   Speed
    -   Linking c++ code (shwocase some GUI)
    -   Some node modules built in
